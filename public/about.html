<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a motivated B.Tech (CAI) student at Vignan’s Institute of Engineering for Women with a strong interest in web technologies and emerging fields like AI & ML. I have built a solid technical foundation through academic learning and hands-on training, gaining skills in Python, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and database technologies. With a CGPA of 7.05 and consistent academic progress, I focus on improving both my technical expertise and problem-solving abilities to prepare for real-world industry challenges. </p>

<p>I completed industrial training in Web Technologies and actively participated in technical programs, hackathons, and cybersecurity workshops, which strengthened my practical knowledge and teamwork skills. One of my key projects, Automation of Examcell, involved developing a web-based system using MySQL, PHP, AJAX, and frontend technologies to simplify examination management processes. These experiences helped me understand project development life cycles, collaboration, and applying technical concepts to solve practical problems.</p> 

<p>I am a self-motivated and adaptable individual with strong communication skills, good time management, and the ability to work effectively both independently and in teams. I aim to start my career in a dynamic organization where I can contribute to innovative projects, continuously learn new technologies, and grow as a skilled software or web development professional while adding value to the organization’s goals.</p>
